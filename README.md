# Twitch Authentication for Node.js

Simple lib to get user access tokens from twitch api, glad no one made it before(or even twitch itself).

Don't complain about anything, it's a simple couple of fetchs to catch the Oauth token, if you want anything to be more fancy or think the code is ugly, modify it to stay the way you like or simply don't use it.

Some statements:
- It's an ES Module(it sucks)
- Because using fetches, you need to deal with Promises(It's not rocket science, learn the right way to use it, don't just put async/await everywhere).
